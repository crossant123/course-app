# _Day 1_

## Arrival in Seattle

- ### Arrived in Seattle
  I'm so thankful that Cameron and Samara were in Seattle early. I arrived
  roughly an hour earlier than I expected The Weather was great for Seattle.
  (Cloudy).
- ### Coffee shop with Cameron and Samara
  Eventually, Cameron and I found a fun Coffee shop to try. The Coffee shop was
  called Luna. We ordered coffee and a bunch of sandwiches to eat in the car.
- ### Walked back to the Car
  Our walk back to the car was filled with a bit of sight seeing. we passed by
  many art exhibits and galleries. There was also a cute Bookstore that I wish I
  had went into. Maybe next time?
- ### Traveled to the Ferry Pier
  After eating in the car, and jamming to a early 2000s playlist Cameron
  INSISTED on we left for Hunter's house. Cameron Opted for taking a Ferry Boat,
  which I was very excited about. I've never been on a ferry boat at this point.
- ### Ferryboat ride
  Honest Review: Kinda boring. To describe it in a few words "Car holder Dingy,
  Smelt like Highschool food"

) }

```

## Evening Adventures

- ### Traveled to stores
  After leaving the Ferry, we stopped a few stores and got some small supplies.
- ### Arrived at Hunter's house

  Eventually we made our way to Hunter's House. I had seen photos of it, but
  honestly it was more than I Expected. I invision my first house to look
  nothing like it. The house has a neat little drive way and the bushes and
  trees make a natural fence around the front yard. Its exciting to think of the
  family Him and Dani will raise there.

- #### Meeting Carter, Ian, and Sho

  Dani has spoken well of Carter, and even had thought I might be interest in
  him. I found out quite quick that I wasn't. He's definitely an interesting
  friend and a cool person. But I feel he's a bit inmature and I am kind of
  looking for deeper conversation than motercycles. Ian and Sho are dating, Ian
  reminds me of Hunter a lot. He's funny and it seems Sho really warms up around
  him. I'm not too sure of how they met but I'm hopeful they last.

- ### Traveled with Hunter and friends to Fort Warden

  Carter definitely likes to drive fast, so does Ian. But we made our way to
  this fort. The whole time Dani and Hunter barely told us what was there. But
  it was nice just to hang out with Hunter.

- ### Hangout with Friends at Fort Warden

  The fort is an old aterillary battery. The views from it are amazing! I'm very
  interested in seeing the beach from there. Our time was spent walking around
  and running through dark parts of the bases interier buildings. The whole
  experience was not what I expected from a wedding but it was still an amazing
  day. It began to rain by the time we left.

- ### Traveled to Safeway

- ### Safeway Snack Run

  We stocked up on snacks for the night.

- ### Drive Back to Hunter's house

- ### Hangout with Friends at Hunter's house

  We played games and had a great time catching up.

- ### Drive to Kitsap Memorial State Park

- ### Slept in a Cabin on the Campgrounds for the night

  It was a peaceful night in the cabin, surrounded by nature.
